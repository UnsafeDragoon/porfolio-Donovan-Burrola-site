            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, as I have had such a passion for them ever since I was little. I will talk more about my appreciation for games in the what motivates me section down below, as it is also correlated with my life goals. Besides gaming, I also just have an infatuation with technology in general and love modding software beyond its original purpose. Setting aside tech, I also have a strong love for animals and have had many in the past, with my current one being my cat, Tigger. </p>

            <p>One notable achievement is during middle school, as a member of Tenaya’s Robotics Club, I received a top 3 finish during a notable tournament. During my high school career, I have also maintained 4.0 consistently and received multiple Principal's Honor Roll certificates as well as earning a score of 5 on my first ever AP test for World History, in which I was very proud of. Setting aside notable awards for more personal achievements, I also learned JavaScript of my own coalition via Meta JavaScript tutorials on Coursera.</p>

            <img src="images/pw-pattern.png" alt="">
            <p>I am a person driven by goals, and with that being said, my overarching goal is to eventually become a game developer. I have a deep passion for video games and having the ability to create games as a job sounds like a dream. I know the issues game developers face on a daily basis and have researched the position very thoroughly, even looking for colleges that teach specialized courses with an emphasis on game development. Regardless of that, I still wish to be involved and aspire to make a game that a variety of people may enjoy.</p>
